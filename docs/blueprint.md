## Core Features:

- Story Generation: Generates short Latin stories based on user-selected level, grammar scope, and topic. It will use a Latin lexicon, frequency analysis, and morphological tagging as a tool to filter vocabulary and grammatical structures.
- Illustration Generation: Generates a color illustration for each sentence of the generated story, based on its content. It will call an image generation API as a tool, such as DALLÂ·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion.
- Story Display: Displays the Latin story with corresponding illustrations, pop-up glosses, and optional audio playback.
- Language Toggle: Allows users to toggle between Latin-only and Latin+English display.
- Story Export: Provides functionality to save stories as PDFs or interactive HTML pages for offline use.
- Favorite Story Management: Incorporates a system to allow users to specify and track a personal set of "favorite" stories for future review and enjoyment

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calm and clarity, like a classical sky.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), near white, to ensure readability and simplicity.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#E6D79A), analogous to blue but lighter, to highlight glosses and interactive elements without overwhelming the eye.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' (serif) for a literary and readable feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.  Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, simple icons with a hand-drawn style to complement the illustrations.
- Clean and simple layout with plenty of whitespace to avoid overwhelming language learners.
- Subtle animations for interactive elements like glosses to provide feedback without distraction.
